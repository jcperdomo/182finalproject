Repo for Final Project for CS182. Presidents Agent.

mcts.py contains all code containing the tree formalism and algorithm for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. Important variables are the c and budget variables at the top of the file that control the exploration and time constraints of the algorithm.

paranoid.py and maxN.py contain the algorithms for paranoid and maxN respectively. 

manVsmachine contains the code necessary to play against the ai agents.

rl.py contains the reinforcement learning agent. The parameters to modify performance are located at the top of the file.

There are a number of test***.py files that we used to individually test all of our agents. 

The papers file contains all of the research papers we used for our project. Only some of them directly impacted the work we did and were therefore cited.

In the writeups one can find the written work we did for the project.
